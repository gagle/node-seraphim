- Single instance: third-party modules cannot use it (shouldn't)
- It reads the entire process.env object: it pollutes the object with keys that
		you don't need.
- It forces you to use the "optimist" module to parse the cli options.
- Cannot relocate the argv options, they are always in the first deep level.
- It reads the files synchronously.
- Can only parse .json files.
- Unmaintained.
